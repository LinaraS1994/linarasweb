                                          <h5><strong>Suburbanization in Ufa. Investigating agglomeration functionality to tackle suburbanization.</strong></h5>
                                          <p>This research project aims to develop a proposal to address the challenges posed by suburbanization through the strategic reorganization of the agglomeration. Ufa, an industrial city in central Russia, with a population exceeding one and a half million, is situated on a peninsula between two rivers. As a regional agglomeration hub, Ufa grapples with the adverse effects of suburbanization, marked by job concentration, limited access points, and a scarcity of available land. The resulting commuter overload prompted a comprehensive examination of suburbanization processes at the agglomeration scale.<br><br>The project proposes solutions encompassing the reorganization of workplaces, the optimization of high-speed transportation routes, and the implementation of transport hubs, along with revised land use regulations. A significant challenge faced during the research was the absence of readily available data, a common issue in Russian cities. The majority of data was painstakingly collected manually, necessitating precision and rigorous effort. Through this process, the study of data analysis emerged as a crucial tool, allowing me to unravel the 'WHY' behind urban dynamics. This project catalyzed my subsequent growth, particularly in my role as a data analyst.</p>

                                                <p>Today, virtually every major city worldwide grapples with the challenge of poor air quality. AW|AIR seeks to address this issue by fostering citizen participation. In the European Union, thousands of premature deaths are linked to elevated NO2 concentrations, primarily stemming from road transport, particularly private vehicles. Recognizing air quality as a shared responsibility, public awareness emerges as a pivotal factor in combating the problem. AW|AIR elevates public consciousness through gamification, encouraging a positive impact on air quality. Throughout the research development, I utilized air quality and mobility data.<br><br>The game employs a dual approach, combining both bottom-up and top-down strategies. It incorporates incentives, stimuli, conditions, and gratifications. Participants, upon meeting specific game conditions, receive gratifications such as public transport discounts and increased space dedicated to specific modes of transportation like micromobility. This system enables the prioritization of active participants and prompts others to reconsider their daily means of transportation.<br><br>The inspiration for investigating citizen participation arose from my background. In Russia, citizen involvement is notably limited across various aspects of people's lives, both at federal and local levels. It became crucial for me to explore tools for citizen participation applicable in my home country. This exploration led me to the next phase—working for an NGO with a fundamental goal of constructing and maintaining civil society in the Bashkortostan region.</p>

                                                <p>The research purpose is to conduct a systemic analysis of the historical center of Ufa to propose an evidence-based solution for the cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.<br><br>The research consists of spatial data analysis of attraction points, transportation, services, cycling activities, land use, etc. The second part included massive social analysis with on-site surveys with citizens. With the support of local volunteers, we gathered opinions and ideas concerning public spaces, to estimate their conditions and level of satisfaction.<br><br>The result of the research represents the “passport” for each of the 12 investigated public spaces with information about its physical and social conditions such as the number of visitors and their types, the purpose of visit, time spent, type and frequency of cultural events, infrastructural supply, and recommendations for improvements. The second output is a cycling and pedestrian itinerary proposal. The proposal takes into account spatial analysis as well as microclimatic situations. Ufa like many places in European in the last decades faces extreme temperatures and the scarcity of vegetation that affects the convenience of moving through the city. We used summer 2021 satellite images to identify the overheated streets that require additional measures to implement. Our proposal of the itinerary included recommendations for actions that have to occur to provide the city center with cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. The interventions concerned the narrowing of roads and expansion of sidewalks, construction of bike lanes, planting additional vegetation, and arrangement of pedestrian facilities (drinking fountains, benches, etc.) for every section of the street chosen for the itinerary. This research project is the first step in a long way toward proving the necessity of applying the evidence-based approach for every solution made in the city. The full description of the project can be checked on the <a href="https://irgrb.ru/reseach_ufa_irgb">IUDB webpage</a>.<br><br>This research became a basement for the future investigation of the impacts of spatial interventions on sociocultural aspects.</p>

                                            <h5><strong>Universal methodology. Assessing the economic, urban and social effects of public spaces.</strong></h5>
                                            <p>The project aimed to establish a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the impacts of constructing and revitalizing public spaces. Since 2018, the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation has conducted a competition for outstanding public space projects in small and medium cities nationwide. The winning projects received federal funds for implementation. Over the years, the Republic of Bashkortostan has successfully executed 20 public space projects, all curated by IUDB from concept to opening.<br><br>In 2022, with sufficient time elapsed since the inauguration of the initial public spaces, the team initiated an assessment of the anticipated effects outlined in the conceptual phase. Recognizing the unique nature of each city and public space, the challenge arose: how to measure their diverse impacts? Faced with the absence of a tool for assessing public spaces' influence on city functioning in the country, IUDB took on the pioneering role in this sphere. A multidisciplinary team of urban planners, economists, sociologists, and architects collaborated to craft a universal assessment tool applicable to any region, irrespective of climate, space type, or funding.<br><br>Drawing inspiration from the Global Design Street Initiative's project "Evaluate Street Transformation," the team developed a methodology encompassing three types of effects: city planning, economic, and social. Each effect is measured through several parameters, tailored to the specific type of public space. The methodology incorporates 24 parameters, each with a dedicated measurement instrument, including on-site citizen surveys, interviews, measurements, observations, and open-source data analysis. Furthermore, the methodology facilitates results comparison and draws meaningful conclusions.<br><br>The project garnered approval and positive feedback among diverse experts, and presently, three more regions across the country are incorporating the methodology into their projects.

                                            <p>The research is centered on uncovering the correlation between land surface coverage and urban heat islands (UHI), with a specific focus on potential impacts on public health. This exploration stems from my previous project on public space connectivity in Ufa, where I touched on urban heat issues. In this research, the issue is investigated in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Armenia, being one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the ECA region, is expected to experience warming at levels significantly above global averages. Despite a rising life expectancy in Armenia, reaching 75 years in 2020, urban heat island mitigation measures are notably absent from the country's adaptation plans and development strategies.<br><br>The primary assumption guiding this research is that UHI disproportionately affects Yerevan districts due to an unequal distribution of green public spaces among city areas, leading to varied heat stress experiences. The research exclusively delves into the spatial distribution of heat, its causes, and its repercussions on public health.<br><br>Conducted entirely using open-source data, the methodology employs three types of data. To establish a correlation between urban greenery and UHI, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and LST (land surface temperature) measurements were utilized. These data samples were derived from 2021 satellite images of Yerevan captured by the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 missions, respectively. Demographic data from the last population census in 2011 was also incorporated, with administrative city districts serving as the measurement unit.<br><br>Land surface coverage was classified into five categories, and the proportion of these categories in each district was calculated based on NDVI. The land surface temperature indicator determined the mean temperature increase for each region. The correlation between the proportions of land surface categories and the average temperature increase in the district became apparent. By considering demographics, districts with a higher ratio of the 75+ population were identified. The overlap of higher temperature excess and a high proportion of vulnerable individuals enabled the prioritization of areas in most urgent need of UHI mitigation measures.<br><br>Presented at the EDRA54 conference in Mexico, this research marks my initial foray into studying this global issue. All subsequent projects, in one way or another, are connected to the interdisciplinary experience gained while working on the intersection of various fields.</p>

                                            <h5><strong>Estimating greenery in Yerevan.</strong></h5>
                                            <p>This research focuses on evaluating the accessibility of green public spaces in Yerevan, spurred by previous observations of an urban heat island in the city and its potential impact on public health. Recognizing revegetation as a key strategy for urban heat mitigation, we sought to assess the city's greenery and the distribution of its public green spaces.<br><br>Referencing the Yerevan Green City Action Plan (2017), which highlighted the insufficiency of green spaces contributing to elevated dust concentration and surface overheating, we utilized Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI to estimate vegetation volume in 2022. Results indicated that the amount of publicly accessible green spaces, and the total amount of green spaces, has decreased since 2017. While the provision of greenery exceeded WHO recommendations, there were notable disparities in green public space access across districts. Analyzing each district separately, four of five inhabitants face a scarcity of greenery.<br><br>To address this, we applied the 3-30-300 rule proposed by the Nature Based Solutions Institute, aiming for equal green space access for every citizen. However, our assessment revealed that Yerevan does not stand the test of the 3-30-300 rule.<br><br>Using census data, we identified the most vulnerable districts (the proportion of the population under 4 y.o. and aged 75+) with less greenery, where a significant proportion of the population is at risk of extreme heat exposure. Adhering to the 3-30-300 rule could help rectify this imbalance, providing residents with equal access to green public spaces.<br><br>The research seeks to underscore the inequality of greenery among city areas and aims to prioritize districts for action based on the number of affected populations.
